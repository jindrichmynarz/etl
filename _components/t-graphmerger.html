<p class="flow-text">
Transformer. There are two types of RDF Data Units in LinkedPipes ETL right now.
There is a data unit, that can contain multiple RDF named graphs, which is currently produced only by the <a href="./t-filestordf" title="Files to RDF">Files to RDF</a>, which may transform files containing RDF quads.
When the user then wants to work with such data using components that only support triples, Graph merger is needed to do the conversion.

        The {{page.title}} component takes input that may contain multiple RDF graphs, merges it and produces a single RDF graph.
        Currently, this component is only used after the <a href="./t-filestordf" title="Files to RDF">Files to RDF</a> component, which may produce data with multiple RDF graphs.
