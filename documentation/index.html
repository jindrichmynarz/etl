                        Once you have LinkedPipes ETL <a href="../installation/">installed and running</a>, it is time to explore.
                        Of course, there is not much to see in an empty instance, but let us go through the basics.
                        The image below is what we call a Pipeline.
                        It is a defined data transformation process which consists of interconnected <a href="../components/">components</a>.
                        You can add a component to a pipeline by clicking in an empty space and selecting the desired component from the list, or by dragging and edge to an empty space.
                        Each component has a name, green input ports and yellow output ports.
                        The ports represent Data Units, which can contain either RDF data or regular files, according to their type.
                        Ports are connected by edges, which indicate the flow of data.
                        Only ports representing Data Units of the same type can be connected.
                        In addition, component configuration can be shared among pipelines using <a href="/templates/">component templates</a>.

                        So far, you can name them, display them, edit them and run them. 
                        Once you run a Pipeline, you create its Execution.

                        An Execution is one run of a Pipeline. 
                        It can either succeed or fail.
                        On the Executions page, you can see the currently running executions with their progress as well as finished executions.

                        You can see the start and end time of an Execution as and the amount of disk space it takes up.
                        You can free that disk space by using the trash icon.
                        You can also re-run the execution or edit its Pipeline, which is useful for debugging.

                    In addition, we tagged the components so that you can find them not only by their name, which sometimes you would have to guess, but also by what they do and by the formats they process.
                    Let's say you want to unzip a file.
                    For that, we have the <a href="../components/#t-unpack">Decompress archive</a> component.
                    However, it may be hard to find under that name.
                    Now, you can find it by typing <code>zip</code>.

                    As you create more and more pipelines, you will notice that the ordering of the offered components adjusts to your typical pipeline shape.
                    This is because we now recommend the components ordered by their probability of appearance, based on the other pipelines in the LP-ETL instance.
                    For example, when you process lots of tabular data, your typical pipeline will begin with an <a href="/components/#e-httpget">HTTP get</a> followed by the <a href="/components/#t-tabular">Tabular</a> component.
                    If that is the case, then the Tabular component will be typically listed first, when you drag an edge from the HTTP get component.

                    Components with grey border are invalidated by a change in the pipeline.
                    This can be caused by a change in configuration or connection of a component preceding the invalidated component in the execution.
                    A component can also be invalidated manually by the <i class="material-icons">loop</i> control.
                    These components will run again when the pipeline is resumed.

                    A more interesting use case for pipeline sharing is to provide a reusable piece of a pipeline to be used in other pipelines.
                    This is what we call pipeline fragments and you can see them as sample pipelines in documentation of some of our components, such as <a href="/components/t-sparqlconstruct" title="SPARQL construct">SPARQL construct</a>.
                    In fact, any pipeline can be imported into another existing pipeline as a pipeline fragment.
                    To import a pipeline fragment, click in the pipeline editor as if adding a new component and select the <i class="material-icons">timeline</i> icon.

                    In the pipeline fragment import dialog, there are several options of providing the fragment.
                    The first two are the same as for pipeline import.
                    You can provide a URL of a pipeline in an LP-ETL instance or on the web, you can upload a pipeline in a JSON-LD file.
                    In addition, you can import a local pipeline from the local LP-ETL instance as a pipeline fragment into another pipeline.
                    The list of pipelines in the Local pipeline tab can be filtered by the pipeline name.
