Now you can load the DCAT-AP v1.1 compatible metadata created in [DCAT-AP Dataset](/components/e-dcatap11dataset) and [DCAT-AP Distribution](/components/e-dcatap11distribution) components to a CKAN catalog using the new [DCAT-AP to CKAN](/components/l-dcatap11tockan) loader.
DCAT-AP v1.1 is the current recommendation for data catalogs in the European Union.
