We overhauled the documentation of components.
Now, each component has its own page and a detailed documentation as well as sample usage in an importable pipeline fragment will start to appear there.
An example can be seen in our [{% raw %} {{ mustache }} {% endraw %} component documentation](../components/t-mustache).
