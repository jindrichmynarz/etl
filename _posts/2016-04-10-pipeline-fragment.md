title: Insert pipeline fragment
---

Now it is possible to insert a fragment of a pipeline into an existing pipeline. When you click in the pipeline editor into an empty space, you now have 2 options, either place a component or a pipeline. Pipelines can be inserted from URLs (you can point to pipelines in the same instance or other instances, if their IRIs are dereferencable) or you can input the JSON-LD file containing a pipeline. This file can be obtained by downloading a pipeline.
