Now when you run a pipeline, you can watch it execute in the new graphical pipeline progress view.
It looks the same as the pipeline editor and therefore it is easier to view contents of a particular data unit thant it was before in the list view, especially for more complex pipelines.
You can access the intermediary debug data by clicking on the data unit (the circle on a component) and view the component execution messages and other details by clicking on the component.
When you need to adjust and rerun the pipeline, you can switch to edit mode and continue as before.
