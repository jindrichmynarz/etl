title: Components in pipelines can be disabled for debugging
---

Now, you can disable individual components in pipelines.
This is useful when debugging as you no longer need to copy the whole pipeline and delete components to debug only part of the pipeline.
The disabled components behave as if they are not in the pipeline, however, they can be enabled at any time without the need to delete them and then recreate them again.
