title: Import pipelines from web
---

When you are importing a pipeline from the web, you no longer have to download it and upload it in LP-ETL.
Just copy its URL and use it directly in the import pipeline dialog.
In addition, in pipeline details, you can see the URL, from which a current pipeline can be downloaded as RDF.
You can share this URL and someone else can use it for importing the pipeline directly from your instance.
