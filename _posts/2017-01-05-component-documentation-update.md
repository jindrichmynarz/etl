title: Component documentation update

There is a number of [new components](/components/) present in LinkedPipes ETL.
Now, most of them are properly documented and ready to use.
In addition, each component documentation page now has an "Edit this page" button on top, so if you see a mistake or have a documentation extension, please do not hesitate to submit a pull request.
