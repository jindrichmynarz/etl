Do you have pipelines in [UnifiedViews](http://unifiedviews.eu)? 
Now you can import them to LinkedPipes ETL and enjoy all of our new features.
All you need to do is to use our [uv2etl](https://github.com/linkedpipes/uv2etl) tool.
The conversion needs to be implemented for each UV DPU separately, but we have the core RDF DPUs covered and you can always request a DPU to be added via an issue, or contribute the conversion via a pull request.
